<p>Did you often think of starting a website but didn&#8217;t know how? Or maybe you always thought it was too hard? That you need know programming or design?</p>



<p>Well fear not, In this absolute beginner guide I will talk about creating a website from scratch without even learning HTML/CSS/PHP or reading other long boring articles.</p>



<h2>The Essential Steps to Create Your Own Website. </h2>



<h3>Get yourself a domain name.</h3>



<p>The first thing to do is getting an domain name: the name you want to give to your website.  For example, the domain name of google is &#8220;google.com&#8221;. It is the identity of a website. To get a domain name you should pay an annual fee to the domain name registrar to claim the ownership to that domain name.</p>



<ul><li>Tip to choose a domain name: The domain name shows your website identity. You need to choose your domain name carefully.<br></li><li>Registering a domain name: You can search and register a domain name from <a href="https://www.namesilo.com/register.php?rid=6309463gf">namesilo</a> in cheap price. They also provide lifetime free privacy protection for your domain name.</li></ul>



<h3>Choosing a Web Host and setting up the website.</h3>



<p>Secondly, after getting a domain name you need a place to store your images, content and website files, you are going to need a web hosting. Without web hosting, your website will not be visible on the Internet.</p>



<ul><li>Getting a web hosting: There are tons of web hosting out there in the internet, some of them are free and some are premium. Choosing a free hosting for live website hosting is not recommended but you can try them out.<br>A free web hosting which I recommend is <a href="https://aeonfree.com">AeonFree</a>. It provides free web hosting features which are comparable with some of the premium hosting out there.<br>For Premium hosting, I would recommend <a href="https://ifastnet.com/portal/aff.php?aff=25747">IfastNet</a>. They are affordable and easy to use.<br>(Choosing a web hosting totally depends on you. You can check comparisons for website hosting and choose which suits you.)<br></li><li>Setting up the hosting: You need to create an account on the web hosting website. Creating an account is easy and should not take much time.<br></li><li>Pointing the domain: You need to point the domain name to your hosting provider. Get the nameservers from your hosting provider and point your domain&#8217;s nameservers towards them.</li></ul>



<h3>Getting your website ready for action.</h3>



<p>Now, the next thing to do is setting up your website. You can install WordPress, Joomla, Drupal or any other blog software. I personally recommend to use WordPress because more than 52% of the people use WordPress for their website and It have more theme and plugin options then other blog applications.</p>



<p>You can install WordPress from  Softaculous in <a href="https://aeonfree.com">Aeonfree</a> and <a href="https://ifastnet.com/portal/aff.php?aff=25747">IfastNet</a>. Many of the web hosting provide feature to install wordpress in their control panel.</p>



<h3>Some Additional Tips.</h3>



<ul><li>Setting up Google Analytics: You can check how many visitors you receive on your website from Google Analytics. It&#8217;s easy to setup using wordpress plugin.<br></li><li>Yoast SEO Plugin for wordpress: If you want to increase your website&#8217;s traffic and improve it&#8217;s SEO then Yoast SEO helps to do it.<br></li><li>Setting Up Cloudflare: Cloudflare helps to prevent DDoS atatcks, Provide free SSL to your website and Helps to make your website faster. You can signup for Free Cloudflare Plan to enjoy it&#8217;s benefits.<br></li><li>Submitting your website to search engines: After you finish creating your website, you can submit it to search engines. It&#8217;s totally free.<br><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home">Google Search Console</a><br><a href="https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> </li></ul>
